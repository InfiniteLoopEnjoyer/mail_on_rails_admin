    # makes browsers ignore unsafe-inline and silently break mail styling.

    # Accepted risk (security review): inline styles cannot execute script,

    # carries NO unsafe-inline (self + per-request nonce only), and untrusted
    # mail renders in an iframe sandboxed without allow-scripts or
    # allow-same-origin (email_messages/show). CSS-only injection into a
    # script-less, origin-less frame, with img-src limited to self/data/https
    # and connect-src pinned, is the residual. Eliminating it entirely would
    # mean serving the mail body from its own `src` endpoint (own CSP) rather
    # than srcdoc - deferred as a larger change against a low residual.
