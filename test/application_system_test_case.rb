  # error, hits the right coordinates, and simply never dispatches, no
  # matter how often it is retried. Script-dispatched events are unaffected.
  # So verify delivery - a capture-phase listener on document sees every
  # click that actually dispatched, wherever it lands - and when a click
  # provably never arrived, fall back to element.click() in JS, which
  # follows the same bubbling and default-action path the app's handlers
