# The catch-up path for authenticated writes that clamd was down for
# (scan_status "unscanned" via IMAP APPEND, web import or composer
# copies): once clamav is back, every such row gets a real verdict,
# recorded in place - never re-filed, these rows live where their owner
# put them. A scanner that is still down leaves everything pending; the
# owner's own authored copies are swept like anything else (the
# rescannable? exclusion is button policy, not scanning policy).
