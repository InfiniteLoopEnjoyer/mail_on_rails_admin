# A draft being composed in the web UI.
#
# There is no separate drafts table: a draft *is* an EmailMessage in the
# account's Drafts mailbox carrying the \Draft flag, which is the only way
# an IMAP client will ever see it. That makes the mailbox the single source
# of truth, and the web UI a peer of the phone rather than a second store
# that has to be reconciled with one.
#
# Saving follows the same shape as IMAP's own REPLACE (RFC 8508), because
# it is the only shape available: messages are immutable, so a revision is
# a *new* message plus an expunge of the one it supersedes. Every save
# therefore mints a new id and a new UID - callers must carry the id
# forward rather than assume it is stable. The same is true in reverse: a
# phone editing this draft replaces the message out from under us, so a
# save against a superseded revision is expected, not exceptional (see
# #save, which treats a missing previous revision as "already gone").
