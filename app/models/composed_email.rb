# An email composed in the web UI. deliver builds the RFC822 message and
# routes each recipient the same way the SMTP edge would: local addresses
# (accounts or aliases) go straight into their account's INBOX, remote ones
# are queued as SmtpOutboundMessages for DeliverSmtpOutboundJob. A \Seen
# copy is filed into the sender's Sent folder.
#
# The composer is a submission edge in its own right, so it carries the
# same anti-abuse gates as authenticated SMTP: each recipient consumes a
# slot from the account's shared send quota (what bounds a stolen
# password's worth), and the built message is scored by rspamd before
# anything is queued.
